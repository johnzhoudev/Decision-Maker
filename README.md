# Decision-Maker

Have you ever felt stuck making an innocuous and arbitrary binary decision? Don't know whether to say yes or no? \
Well, we've got your back! 

Introducing the Decision Maker, the app that generates a Yes or No at random at each tap! Feel the power underneath your
fingertips! (Quite literally, there's haptic feedback!)

# Inspiration

My 2 best friends Longman, Tommy and I struggle to make simple yes or no decisions every day. We usually rely on coin flips, but this is so archaic that my team and I decided it was time the world needed an update.

# Challenges in the Making

We are all relatively new to swift and IOS app development, so we had no idea how to do anything in the beginning. The biggest challenge was researching how to make all aspects of our app within the time constraints and also get an adequate amount of sleep.

# Points of Pride 

Obviously, the final product. It's clean and the UI experience can be described as intoxicatingly smooth and instantly responsive while still being firmly grounded in the palm of your hand.

# What's next for Decision Maker

An advanced decision maker view that takes a question and also accepts "considerations" which can each be scored with a slider from -10 to 10 representing the weighting of the consideration as a con and pro. The user will be able to add as many considerations as they want, and when they press the "decide" button the phone will add up all the points from the considerations and will output the overall best decision depending on the total "pro" points and "con" points.
